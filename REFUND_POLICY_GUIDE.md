# Refund Policy Options for GLP-1 Mindful Evenings

## Current Policy (No Refunds)
Your Terms of Service currently states "No refunds for partial months" which is legally acceptable for digital services.

## Option 1: Keep No Refunds (Simplest)
**Pros:**
- Reduces administrative overhead
- Prevents subscription abuse
- Common for wellness/content apps
- Already documented in ToS

**Cons:**
- May deter some customers
- Could generate support complaints
- Less customer-friendly

## Option 2: Limited Refund Policy (Recommended)
Add to your Terms of Service:

```
REFUND POLICY:
- 7-day money-back guarantee for first-time subscribers
- Refunds processed within 5-7 business days
- No refunds after 7 days of subscription activation
- Contact Dan@chase-wellness.com for refund requests
```

**Pros:**
- Builds customer trust
- Reduces buyer hesitation
- Shows confidence in your product
- Still limits abuse with time restriction

**Cons:**
- Some administrative work
- Potential revenue loss (typically <5%)

## Option 3: Full Satisfaction Guarantee (Most Generous)
```
REFUND POLICY:
- 30-day money-back guarantee
- Cancel anytime for unused portion
- Full refunds processed within 5-7 business days
```

**Pros:**
- Maximum customer confidence
- Competitive advantage
- Shows strong product faith

**Cons:**
- Higher administrative burden
- More potential refund requests
- Revenue risk

## Implementation Steps (if you choose Option 2):

1. **Update Terms of Service** - Add refund section
2. **Set up Stripe refund process** - Configure in dashboard
3. **Create support workflow** - Handle refund requests
4. **Update marketing copy** - Mention guarantee

## Recommendation:
Go with **Option 2** (7-day guarantee) as it balances customer trust with business protection for a $2.99/month service.
